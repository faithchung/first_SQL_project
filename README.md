# first_SQL_project

Final project for the CFG Introduction to Data Science and SQL

Evaluate Business Impact timely and smartly.
The pandemic shows the shortcomings of business continuity planning of many organisations:
* Organisations have very little capacity to keep their business impact analysis up-to-date. The common practice is to review it once a year as a tick box exercise.
* The world is changing at a faster pace than ever: pandemic, unsettling because of political environments and natural disasters.
* Organisations want to wait for official guidance (e.g. from the Governments, WHO, etc.). However, they may not come in-time or fit the situation.
* There’s too much information on the web. Businesses don’t know how to translate it to policies and measures to suit the organisation. They also have little clue about the effects of the changes they want to make.
* Small businesses don’t have dedicated teams to perform business continuity planning.
The team would like to explore a way to enable businesses to use collective intelligence across the organisation to plan and respond to potential events based on the organisation profile proactively. They can also share and contribute their learning and thoughts with other organisations too.
We are planning to use the data table below:
1. Employee details
2. Grade and Salary
3. Department and keywords of insights they would be interested in
4. Employees and keywords of insights they would be interested in
5. Employee health condition
6. Employee household responsibilities
7. Employees’ views on insights
8. Keywords of different insights (from social media, news, gov guidance)
9. Insight titles and corresponding ids
